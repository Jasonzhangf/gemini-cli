# Packages

This directory contains all the core packages of the Gemini CLI project. Each subdirectory is an independent package that encapsulates a specific part of the application's functionality.

- **`core`**: Contains the core logic for content generation, model interaction, and configuration management.
- **`cli`**: Implements the command-line interface, handling user input, command parsing, and output rendering.

Please refer to the `readme.md` file within each package's directory for more detailed information.
